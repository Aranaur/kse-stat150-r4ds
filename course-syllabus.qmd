# 🧭Welcome to Our Expedition!

Welcome, young explorers!

This semester, we are setting off on a thrilling scientific expedition to the icy shores of Antarctica. Our lead guide is an experienced polar explorer, a penguin named **Pipe**[^pipe]. He knows everything about data, because his whole life is data: the length of his beak, his wingspan, and even his favorite type of fish!

[^pipe]: He got his name for his amazing ability to combine different actions into one smooth and logical flow, as if passing data through an invisible "pipeline" (`|>`). This is the approach he wants to pass on to you!

Our mission is to learn the R language to understand penguins, analyze their lives, and present our findings to the world. Forget about boring lectures. We have **campfire briefings**, **field research**, and a final **Grand Penguin Gala Presentation** awaiting us!

## 🪶History of the Expedition

::: {.column-margin}
![](img/penguin_research.png)
:::

Once upon a time, in faraway Antarctica, penguins lived their quiet lives until the first explorers arrived and started collecting data on their behavior. Over time, this data turned into massive sets of information that needed analysis. That was when Pipe appeared, a researcher penguin who learned to use R to understand his world. Now Pipe wants to share his knowledge with you so that you can help him uncover the secrets of penguin life.

## 🤫The Mystery of the Expedition

Lately, Pipe has noticed something strange. The population of his favorite fish, the ice sardine, has started to decline sharply near the coast. What is happening? Is it climate change? A new predator? Or perhaps the fish have simply migrated?

**Our mission** is to use the full power of R to analyze data on water temperature, ocean currents, the activity of other animals, and find the answer. The final project will serve as your report to the International Penguin Council, where you will present your findings and save the future of the ice sardines!

# 🧊Expedition Survival Rules

::: {.column-margin}
![](img/rules.png)
:::

- **How to Earn Explorer Badges (Grading)**: Your successes are recorded in the logbook. For every timely weekly report, you receive up to 10 points. The final gala presentation of your research is worth 30 points. The most active explorers at briefings can receive up to 5 bonus points.
- **If You Get Caught in a Snowstorm (Deadline Policy)**: We understand that anything can happen on an expedition. You can submit a report up to 3 days late, but every day of the storm "eats up" 20% of the maximum grade.
- **Polar Explorer's Honor (Academic Integrity)**: True explorers rely on their own strength. You can consult at base camp, but the map of your research (code and reports) must be unique. Plagiarism is like trying to pass off someone else's find as your own. Such actions are not tolerated.
- **Using Robot Assistants** (Artificial Intelligence): In our expedition, the use of high-tech drones (ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, etc.) is allowed. You can ask them to explain complex code, look for errors (debug), or generate ideas for visualization. **BUT**: You are the lead researcher. The robot cannot write the report for you. You must understand all the code that goes into your logbook. If Pipe asks you "what does this function do?" and you say "I don't know, the robot wrote it"—that is a mission failure. *Rule*: If you used AI to generate part of the code, state this in a comment (e.g., `# generated using Copilot, verified by me`).

## 📖Expedition Logbook: Route Details

:::{.column-page-right}

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### **Week 1: 🧳 Packing Suitcases**
*   **Topic:** R Basics, IDE, Data Types.
    *   **Task:** Researchers from the 'Palmer' Antarctic station have sent us the first file. It contains basic data on the penguin population. Our first task is to open this "evidence container" in RStudio, check if all data is in place, and determine where we have numbers (beak length), where we have text (penguin species), and where we have logical variables (whether a chick was sighted). This is the foundation of our investigation, and we must be confident in the quality of our first evidence.
    *   **Result of Report #1:** The researcher loads the data, uses functions `str()`, `summary()`, `class()`, and writes a short conclusion.
:::
::: {.column}
#### **Week 2: 🐧 First Steps on Ice**
*   **Topic:** `dplyr`, `tidyr` (data transformation).
    *   **Task:** We received a new file about the temperature regime. But the data was collected from several buoys, and it is, to put it mildly, messy. Somewhere there are gaps (`NA`), somewhere the temperature is in Fahrenheit instead of Celsius. Your task is to "clean up the crime scene": using `dplyr`, filter out records from broken buoys, using `mutate()`, create a new column with temperature in Celsius, and using `select()`, keep only the most important columns. We cannot look for anomalies in dirty data.
    *   **Result of Report #2:** The researcher provides code for cleaning the data and the final "clean" table.
:::
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### **Week 3: 📓 Keeping the Captain's Log**
*   **Topic:** `Quarto` (reports).
    *   **Task:** The International Penguin Council demands the first interim report. They don't want to see just code. They need a professional document. Your task is to format the results of the previous week (cleaned data) into a Quarto report. Add headings, a text description of your actions, the code itself, and the output (e.g., the first 6 rows of the clean table). This is our first official document in the case of the disappearing sardines!
    *   **Result of Report #3:** A professionally formatted PDF or HTML report documenting the first steps of the investigation.
:::
::: {.column}
#### **Week 4: 🗺️ Visualizing Colony Data**
*   **Topic:** `ggplot2` (visualization).
    *   **Task:** Dry numbers are good, but we need a picture! Using cleaned temperature data and sardine population data, create a chart using `ggplot2`. On the X-axis—years, on the Y-axis—water temperature and sardine count. Is there a visual correlation? Is it true that when the water gets warmer, there are fewer fish? This could be our first serious piece of evidence!
    *   **Result of Report #4:** A chart with a conclusion: Visual analysis shows a potential inverse relationship between water temperature and sardine population. Further research is needed.
:::
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### **Week 5: 📡 Listening to Penguin Talk**
*   **Topic:** Web scraping, API.
    *   **Task:** One hypothesis is the change in sea ice area. We don't have this data, but the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) publishes it online. Your task is to collect data on Antarctic ice area for the last 10 years using `rvest` (or via API, if available). Is there a declining trend? This could be another factor affecting the ecosystem.
    *   **Result of Report #5:** A script for data collection and the obtained dataset with a short description.
:::
::: {.column}
#### **Week 6: 🔍 Techniques for Advanced Explorers**
*   **Topic:** `DuckDB`, `Arrow` (big data).
    *   **Task:** We were handed a giant archive. It contains millions of records on fishing vessel activity. Opening it in Excel is suicide. Use `Arrow` and `DuckDB` to efficiently analyze this data without loading it into memory. Our question: has fishing activity increased in the sardine disappearance area in recent years?
    *   **Result of Report #6:** An SQL query via `DuckDB` to the file and the result (e.g., an aggregated table by years) with a conclusion.
:::
:::

::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
#### **Week 7: 🗺 Mapping Uncharted Lands**
*   **Topic:** `sf` (spatial analysis).
    *   **Task:** We have coordinates of temperature buoys, fishing data, and places where sardines disappeared. Time to put it all on a map! Using `sf`, create a map of the region. Mark thermal anomalies (highest temperature), intense fishing zones, and places where sardines were seen previously. are there "hot spots" where all these factors intersect? This could be the epicenter of our mystery.
    *   **Result of Report #7:** A map of the region with data layers applied and a conclusion about the spatial overlap of factors.
:::
::: {.column}
#### **Week 8: 🎉 Grand Penguin Gala Presentation!**
*   **Topic:** Final Project.
    *   **Task:** Zero Hour. You have collected all the evidence. Now combine the results of all previous reports (text, code, charts, maps) into one final, comprehensive report in Quarto. Draw a clear conclusion, answering the main question: **what happened to the ice sardine?** Present your theory, backed by the data you analyzed throughout the expedition.

# 🏕️Our Base Camp

No explorer works alone! Our base camp is a shared Slack chat where we:

- Share interesting findings (useful articles, R packages).
- Help each other if someone gets stuck in a snowdrift (code hanging).
- Prepare together for new stages of the expedition.

**Remember:** the strength of the expedition is in its team!

Ready for adventure? Then forward, to data and penguins! 🐧🧭
