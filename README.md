## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to the official repository for **STAT150: R for Data Science**, taught at the **Kyiv School of Economics (KSE)** in Autumn 2025.

This course is designed to take students from zero programming experience to professional-grade data analysis skills using the modern **Tidyverse** ecosystem. We focus not just on syntax, but on the art of discovering stories hidden within data.
