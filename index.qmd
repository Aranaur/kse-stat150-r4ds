Welcome to the homepage for **STAT150: R for Data Science**. This course is taught by [Dr. Ihor Miroshnychenko](https://aranaur.rbind.io/) in Autumn 2025 at the Kyiv School of Economics.

## 🚀 Why learn R?

Data is the new language of business, economics, and science. In this course, you won't just learn "how to code" --- you will learn how to **discover stories hidden within data**.

R is not just a programming language; it is a vast ecosystem designed specifically for data analysis. Whether you want to visualize economic trends, analyze marketing metrics, or automate reports, R is the industry standard tool used by companies like Google, Facebook, and Uber.

## Is this course for me?
**Yes!** This course is designed for beginners. We assume **no prior programming experience**. We start from zero and build up to professional-grade data analysis skills using the modern "Tidyverse" approach.

## 🎯 What you will learn

By the end of this course, you will possess the toolkit to turn raw data into actionable insights. We will focus on the practical cycle of Data Science:

*   **Import:** Getting data from files, databases, or APIs.
*   **Tidy:** Cleaning and organizing messy real-world data.
*   **Transform:** Selecting, filtering, and summarizing key information.
*   **Visualize:** Creating stunning, publication-quality graphics with `ggplot2`.
*   **Communicate:** Publishing your results using Quarto and Markdown.

## 🛠️ Course Philosophy

We believe in **hands-on learning**. You won't just memorize syntax; you will solve real problems. The curriculum follows the philosophy of the famous book *R for Data Science* by Hadley Wickham, focusing on writing code that is easy to read, easy to share, and easy to reproduce.

> "Data science is an exciting discipline that allows you to turn raw data into understanding, insight, and knowledge." — *Hadley Wickham*
